# Neo FFT3D (forked from fft3dfilter)

Neo FFT3D Copyright(C) 2020 Xinyue Lu, and previous developers

FFT3DFilter is a 3D Frequency Domain filter - strong denoiser and moderate sharpener. It was originally written by Alexander G. Balakhnin aka Fizick, and later modified by martin53 for AviSynth 2.6 and later modified by Ferenc Pint√©r aka pinterf for further improvement, high bit depth, and more. Kudos to them for creating and improving this fantastic tool.

In this project, legacy format like YUY2 has been removed, legacy parameter like multiplane has been removed, and SIMD code has been completely re-written for all core parts of the code. Due to API change, the project has been renamed from FFT3DFilter to Neo_FFT3D to avoid confusion. SSE is required to run optimized routine. AVX and AVX512 routine is also available.

## Usage

```python
# AviSynth+
LoadPlugin("neo-fft3d.dll")
neo_fft3d(clip, sigma=2.0, bt=3, y=3, u=3, v=3, ...)
# VapourSynth
core.neo_fft3d.FFT3D(clip, sigma=2.0, bt=3, planes=[0,1,2], ...)
```

Parameters:

[Check original usage documents.](https://avisynth.org.ru/fft3dfilter/fft3dfilter.html)

- *bt*

    * -1: Sharpen and dehalo only
    * 0: Temporal Kalman filter
    * 1: 2D (spatial) Wiener filter
    * 2: 3D Wiener filter for 2 frames
    * 3: 3D Wiener filter for 3 frames
    * 4: 3D Wiener filter for 4 frames
    * 5: 3D Wiener filter for 5 frames
    * As shown below:

        |bt | prev2 | prev1 |current| next1 | next2 |
        |---|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
        | 1 |       |       |   o   |       |       |
        | 2 |       |   o   |   o   |       |       |
        | 3 |       |   o   |   o   |   o   |       |
        | 4 |   o   |   o   |   o   |   o   |       |
        | 5 |   o   |   o   |   o   |   o   |   o   |

    Default: 3.

- *sigma*

    Denoise strongness.

    Default: 2.0.

- *y*, *u*, *v* (AviSynth+ only)

    Whether a plane is to be filtered.

        1 - Do not touch, leaving garbage data
        2 - Copy from origin
        3 - Process

    Default: 3.

- *planes* (VapourSynth only)

    Planes to be filtered.

    Default: [0,1,2].

- *l*, *t*, *r*, *b*

    Exclude part of image to be filtered.

    Non-filtered part is copied from the source.

    Default: 0.

- *opt*

    Sets which CPU optimizations to use.

        <0 - Auto detect
        0 - Auto detect with AVX512 disabled
        1 - Use C
        2 - Use up to SSE
        3 - Use up to AVX
        4 - Use up to AVX512

    Default: 0.

- *ncpu*

    Number of FFTW multi threads.

    Default: 2.

- *mt*

    Process planes in parallel.

    Default: false.


### Note on MT (multi-threading)

Neo_FFT3D is MT-compatible. Do not invoke more than 6 threads, or otherwise it'll start using lots of memory. The sweet spot is likely be 2-4.

Neo_FFT3D is partially multi-threaded inside. Without MT it still runs quick.
